This folder contains all the codes used for the Simulation 1(b) in our paper.

Simulation 1(b) is about simulated data comparisons under three different contamination levels: 10%, 20% and 30%.

Folder “HSP.0.0.3.5_level10” contains all the codes and simulation replicated results of our HSP method under 10% contamination level. Similarly, folder “HSP.0.0.3.5_level20” is for 20% level, and folder ““HSP.0.0.3.5_level30” is for 30% level. While the codes and parameter values remain the same across three different contaminated levels, the simulated datas are the only difference.

Folder “NoBLoC_level10_results” contains the 50 replicated simulation results of NoB-LoC method under 10% contamination level. Likewise, “NoBLoC_level20_results” for 20% level and ““NoBLoC_level30_results” for 30% level. Again, we don’t provide the implementation codes of NoB-LoC here. If you are interested in it, please contact with the author Dr. Juhee Lee from University of California Santa Cruz.

The file “Sim1b_plots.Rmd” contains the codes to generate the comparison plots for Simulation 1(b). We also put the 4 plots for Simulation 1(b) in the folder, for your convenience.
